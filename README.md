# Beginner projects to learn python
These are some projects to start coding with Python. All of these are 100% beginner-friendly.

We want to get into data types like strings, integers, floats, and booleans. After this, we want to work with complex data structures like lists, dictionaries, etc.

## How to use it
In every folder, you will find a README.md with additional information and a work_with.md. The work_with.md contains some functions and methods to work with this data type. Get used to this before you start the projects. Every project requires you to code a program to fix a problem. The solution to the projects is in the same .py file. First, try to solve it on your own and only use the solution if you need it.

## Recommended order of projects:

Start with the data type string:
1. mail_merge
2. scrabble
3. work_with_string
4. madlibs
