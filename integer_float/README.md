# Data type: `integer` and `float`
Before you start with these projects, you should have knowledge about the `string` data type.
An `integer`, or `int`, is a whole number. It has no decimal point and contains all counting numbers (1, 2, 3, â€¦) as well as their negative counterparts and the number 0. A floating-point number, or a `float`, is a decimal number. It can be used to represent fractional quantities as well as precise measurements.
```
integer = 17
float = 3.5
```
## How to use
Start with the work_with_int_float.md file in this folder. The work_with_int_float.md contains some functions and methods to work with this data type. Get used to this before you start the projects. Every project requires you to code a program to fix a problem. The solution to the projects is in the same .py file. First, try to solve it on your own and only use the solution if you need it.
