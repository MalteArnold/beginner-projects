# Data type: `integer` and `float`
A `string` is a data type that contains a data structure of bytes (or words) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters.
`Strings` can be stored in variables and are declared with " or ' at the beginning and the end.
```
integer = 17
float = 3.5
```
## How to use
Start with the work_with_int_float.md file in this folder. The work_with_int_float.md contains some functions and methods to work with this data type. Get used to this before you start the projects. Every project requires you to code a program to fix a problem. The solution to the projects is in the same .py file. First, try to solve it on your own and only use the solution if you need it.
