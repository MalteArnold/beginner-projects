# Working with strings
A string is a data type that contains a data structure of bytes (or words) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters.
Strings can be stored in variables and are declared with " or ' at the beginning and the end.
```
name = "Joe"
```
## How to use
In every folder, you will find a README.md with additional information and a work_with.md. The work_with.md contains some functions and methods to work with this data type. Get used to this before you start the projects. Every project requires you to code a program to fix a problem. The solution to the projects is in the same .py file. First, try to solve it on your own and only use the solution if you need it.
## Recommended order of projects:
1. mail_merge
2. scrabble
