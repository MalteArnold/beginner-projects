# Work with string
Here we are going to some functions and methods to use the data type string.
***
A string is generally considered a data type and is often implemented as an array data structure of bytes (or words) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some character encoding.
## Store string in variable
```
string = "Hello my name is Joe"
```
## Testing data type with `type()` and displaying it using `print()`
```
print(type(string))
```
Strings are fundamentally immutable. After creating a string object, individual characters cannot be altered.
But we can store the modified string in a new variable. More on that later.
## Accessing individual characters (index) starting from 0, ending at -1 and displaying it using `print()`
```
print(string[0])
```
